## Challenges

| Name                                       |  DIfficulty | Summary                                                                                               |
|:------------------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| [Simple Decryption](./simple-encrypt-decrypt-RSA/) | easy | Simple RSA Decryption |
| [Factorize N giving d](./Factorize-n-giving-d/) | easy | The challenge involves factorize N giving d |
| [Large e small d](./Large-e-small-d/) | easy | The challenge involves a scenario where the **public exponent ùëí  is unusually large**, resulting in a private key exponent **ùëë that is relatively small**. |
| [Fermat Factorization](./Fermat-Factorization/) | easy | The challenge involves using Fermat Factorization which work best when **p and q are near the square-root of N** |
| [Multiple Primes](./Multiple-Primes/) | easy | N is composed with more than 2 primes |
| [One Prime](./One-Prime/) | easy | N equal p^2 |
