# Simple Encrypt-Decrypt RSA

This write-up shows how RSA encryption and decryption work in textbook RSA. If the **private key** is known.

## ðŸ“„ RSA Overview

RSA is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. Below are the key steps and equations involved.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Generation

1. **Choose two large prime numbers**:  
   p and q.  
   Compute their product:  
   `n = p Ã— q`

2. **Calculate Eulerâ€™s Totient Function**:  
   `Ï†(n) = (p - 1) Ã— (q - 1)`

3. **Select a public key exponent** e such that:  
   `1 < e < Ï†(n)` and `gcd(e, Ï†(n)) = 1`

4. **Compute the private key exponent** d as the modular inverse of e modulo Ï†(n):  
   `d Ã— e â‰¡ 1 (mod Ï†(n))`

The **public key** is **(e, n)** and the **private key** is **(d, n)**.

## ðŸ”’ Encryption

Given a plaintext message M (as an integer), the ciphertext C is computed as:  
`C â‰¡ M^e (mod n)`

## ðŸ”‘ Decryption

To decrypt the ciphertext C, use the private key d:  
`M â‰¡ C^d (mod n)`

This retrieves the original plaintext message M.
